                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>Mission is the core purpose of an organization or a company. It is a summary of the aims and core values. A mission clearly tells what you as an organization does for customers. A mission is comprehensive but also very specific to set you apart from other organizations.</p>

                <h2>Vission</h2>
                <p>A vision is the bigger picture. Your life's vision defines who you want to be, what you want to be known for and the set of experiences and accomplishments you aim for. Your vision helps define the goals by giving you a framework to evaluate those goals.</p>

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>Life goals are all the things you want to accomplish in your life. Often your life goals are very meaningful to you and can make a lasting impact on your life. They can be large and challenging goals, or they can be smaller and more personal. It all depends on what you want to achieve.</p>
